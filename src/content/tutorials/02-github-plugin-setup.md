# Video Tutorial 2: GitHub Plugin Setup

**Duration:** 4-6 minutes
**Demo Repo:** [relicta-demo](https://github.com/relicta-tech/relicta-demo)

## Overview

This tutorial shows how to install and configure the GitHub plugin to automatically create GitHub releases with binaries and release notes.

## Prerequisites

- Relicta installed
- GitHub repository
- GitHub personal access token (for local) or `GITHUB_TOKEN` (for CI)

## Script

### Scene 1: Introduction (30s)

> "Relicta plugins extend your release workflow with powerful integrations.
>
> In this tutorial, we'll set up the GitHub plugin to automatically
> create GitHub releases, upload binaries, and generate release notes
> directly on your repository."

### Scene 2: Installing the Plugin (1 min)

```bash
# List available plugins
relicta plugin list --available

# Install the GitHub plugin
relicta plugin install github

# Enable it
relicta plugin enable github

# Verify installation
relicta plugin list
```

**Narration:**
> "Installing plugins with Relicta is straightforward.
> The plugin is downloaded from the official registry,
> checksums are verified for security, and it's ready to use."

### Scene 3: Configuration (1.5 min)

```yaml
# relicta.config.yaml
plugins:
  - name: github
    enabled: true
    config:
      # Owner and repo (auto-detected from git remote)
      # owner: your-org
      # repository: your-repo

      # Release settings
      draft: false           # Create as draft first
      prerelease: false      # Mark as prerelease
      generate_notes: true   # Use GitHub's auto-notes

      # Assets to upload
      assets:
        - "dist/*.tar.gz"
        - "dist/*.zip"
        - "dist/checksums.txt"
```

**Key Points:**
- Explain auto-detection of owner/repo
- Show draft vs published releases
- Demonstrate asset glob patterns

### Scene 4: Authentication (1 min)

```bash
# Option 1: Environment variable
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Option 2: GitHub CLI (recommended for local dev)
gh auth status

# Option 3: .env file
echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxx" >> .env
```

**Narration:**
> "For authentication, you have several options:
> - Use a personal access token in an environment variable
> - Leverage the GitHub CLI's existing authentication
> - Store it in a .env file for local development
>
> In CI/CD, the workflow's GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically available."

### Scene 5: Running a Release (1.5 min)

```bash
# Build your release assets
make release

# Run the full workflow
relicta plan
relicta bump
relicta notes
relicta approve --yes
relicta publish
```

**Show:**
- Plugin loading message
- GitHub release being created
- Assets being uploaded
- Final release URL

**Narration:**
> "When you run publish, the GitHub plugin:
> 1. Creates a new release on your repository
> 2. Uploads all matching assets
> 3. Sets the release notes from your changelog
> 4. Makes it available for download
>
> Check your GitHub releases page to see the result!"

### Scene 6: CI/CD Integration (30s)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yaml
- name: Publish Release
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    relicta plan
    relicta bump
    relicta notes
    relicta approve --yes
    relicta publish
```

**Narration:**
> "In GitHub Actions, the GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically available
> with the permissions you've configured. No additional secrets needed!"

### Scene 7: Summary (30s)

> "You've now set up the GitHub plugin to:
> - Automatically create GitHub releases
> - Upload binary assets
> - Generate release notes
>
> In the next video, we'll explore multi-platform publishing
> to npm, Docker Hub, and more."

## Common Issues

1. **401 Unauthorized**: Check token permissions (needs `contents: write`)
2. **Asset not found**: Verify glob patterns match your build output
3. **Rate limiting**: Use authenticated requests to increase limits
