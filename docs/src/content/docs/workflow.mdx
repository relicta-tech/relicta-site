Relicta governs the full release flow — from analyzing changes to publishing with audit trails.

## Quick Release (Recommended)

Run the complete workflow with a single command:

```bash
# Interactive release
relicta release

# CI/CD (auto-approve)
relicta release -y

# Preview without changes
relicta release --dry-run
```

This runs: **plan → bump → notes → approve → publish**

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

For more control, run each step individually:

## 1) Plan
```bash
relicta plan
relicta plan -a  # Include detailed analysis
```
- Analyzes commits since the last tag.
- Calculates the required semantic bump.
- Shows a preview of the release plan.
- Flags: `-f/--from`, `-t/--to`, `-a/--analyze`, `--json`, `--dry-run`.

## 2) Generate notes (optional AI)
```bash
relicta notes -a   # Enable AI-powered notes
relicta notes --ai # Same as above
```
- Drafts release notes and changelog entries.
- Uses your configured AI provider and tone.
- Flags: `-a/--ai`, `-s/--save`, `--tone`, `--audience`, `--json`, `--dry-run`.

## 3) Approve
```bash
relicta approve
relicta approve -y  # Auto-approve without prompting
```
- Locks the plan and captures approval context.
- Keeps an audit trail before publishing.
- Flags: `-y/--yes`, `-e/--edit`, `-i/--interactive`, `--by <name>`, `--note <text>`.

## 4) Publish
```bash
relicta publish
relicta publish -P  # Skip pushing to remote
```
- Creates the tag and runs plugins (GitHub release, npm, Slack, etc.).
- Uses your config for tag prefix, push behavior, and targets.
- Flags: `-A/--skip-approval`, `-T/--skip-tag`, `-P/--skip-push`, `-G/--skip-plugins`.

## Dry runs
Add `--dry-run` to preview without modifying the repo.

## JSON + automation
Every command supports `--json` for structured output. Pair with `jq` to feed dashboards, chat notifications, or custom CI steps.

## Common patterns
- **Standard release**: `relicta release` for interactive, `relicta release -y` for CI/CD.
- **Local preview**: `relicta release --dry-run` to validate the entire workflow.
- **Approval flow**: Have a second reviewer run `relicta approve --by "<name>" --note "<context>"` before publish.
- **Force version**: `relicta release -F v2.0.0` to set a specific version.
- **Hotfix**: Run `relicta plan -f <last-release> -t HEAD --json` to verify the bump and publish from a hotfix branch; ensure branch is in `allowed_branches`.
- **Skip push**: `relicta publish -P` when CI handles git operations.

## Governance integration
Enable risk-aware decisions with the [Change Governance Protocol (CGP)](/governance):
- **Risk scoring**: Automatic assessment of blast radius, actor trust, and security impact.
- **Approval gates**: Require human review for high-risk or breaking changes.
- **Audit trails**: Every decision is captured for compliance.
