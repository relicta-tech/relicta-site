description: Use Relicta in GitHub Actions for zero-install pipelines.
draft: false
---

Use the GitHub Action to avoid installing the CLI in your workflow runner. Checksums are verified automatically.

```yaml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: relicta-tech/relicta-action@v2
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          ai-provider: openai
          publish: true
          config: relicta.config.yaml
```

## Inputs to know
- `github-token` (required for GitHub releases and repo access).
- `ai-provider` (`openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `azure`, `ollama`) and provider-specific keys/secrets.
- `config`: path to `relicta.config.yaml` (defaults to repo root).
- `dry-run`: `true` to preview without tagging/publishing.
- `publish`: `true` to run the full flow; set `false` for plan/notes-only checks.
- `args`: extra CLI args (e.g., `--json` or `--from <ref>`).

See the action docs: https://github.com/relicta-tech/relicta-action

## Secrets and environment
- Set provider tokens as encrypted secrets (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, `NPM_TOKEN`, `LAUNCHNOTES_API_TOKEN`).
- Ensure `actions/checkout` fetches tags if you plan to publish (`fetch-depth: 0`).

## CI patterns
- **Plan-only PR check**: run `publish: false` with `args: --json` and annotate the PR with the proposed version and notes.
- **Manual approval gate**: combine with environment protection rules; run `publish: true` only after approval.
- **Matrix releases**: use strategy matrices for multi-platform testing, then a single release job that runs Relicta once.
