Relicta wraps the full release flow in one CLI.

## 1) Plan
```bash
relicta plan
```
- Analyzes commits since the last tag.
- Calculates the required semantic bump.
- Shows a preview of the release plan.

## 2) Generate notes (optional AI)
```bash
relicta notes --ai
```
- Drafts release notes and changelog entries.
- Uses your configured AI provider and tone.

## 3) Approve
```bash
relicta approve
```
- Locks the plan and captures approval context.
- Keeps an audit trail before publishing.

## 4) Publish
```bash
relicta publish
```
- Creates the tag and runs plugins (GitHub release, npm, Slack, etc.).
- Uses your config for tag prefix, push behavior, and targets.

## Dry runs
Add `--dry-run` to preview without modifying the repo.
