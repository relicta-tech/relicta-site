Relicta is an AI-powered release management CLI that automates semantic versioning, release notes, approvals, and publishing. It works locally or in CI and plugs into GitHub releases, npm, Slack, LaunchNotes, and more via plugins.

## When to use Relicta
- You want **predictable semantic versions** from conventional commits without manual bumping.
- You need **polished release notes** and changelog updates that stay on-message.
- You require an **approval step** before publishing for auditability or compliance.
- You want one CLI that can **tag, publish, and notify** across your release channels.

## What Relicta does
- **Plan**: Reads git history to propose the correct semantic version (supports prerelease + build metadata).
- **Notes**: Drafts release notes and changelog entries with AI tone, audience, and provider selection (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Azure, Ollama).
- **Approve**: Locks the plan, capturing approver context for audit.
- **Publish**: Creates tags and drives plugins for GitHub releases, npm, Slack, LaunchNotes, and custom gRPC plugins.
- **Dry runs & JSON**: Preview everything without touching your repo; consume structured output in automation.
- **CI-first**: GitHub Action fetches signed binaries with checksums; no toolchain required on runners.

## Quickstart (local)
```bash
brew install relicta-tech/tap/relicta
relicta init                        # write relicta.config.yaml
relicta release                     # run complete workflow (plan → bump → notes → approve → publish)
```

Or for CI/CD:
```bash
relicta release --yes               # auto-approve for automation
```
