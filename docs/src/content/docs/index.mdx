description: The governance layer for software change. Risk-aware release decisions for humans and agents.
draft: false
---

Relicta is the governance layer for software change. As AI agents and CI systems generate more code, deciding what should ship becomes the hardest problem. Relicta governs change — before it reaches production.

**Today**, Relicta is a production-ready CLI that automates semantic versioning, release notes, approvals, and publishing. **Tomorrow**, it's the decision layer for risk-aware releases in an AI-driven world.

## When to use Relicta
- You need to **govern what changes** reach production — not just automate delivery.
- You want **risk-aware decisions** about releases, especially with AI-generated code.
- You require **approval gates and audit trails** for compliance.
- You want one CLI that can **plan, approve, and publish** across your release channels.

## Core decisions Relicta makes
- **What changed?** — Semantic analysis of commits to determine version impact.
- **Is it risky?** — Risk scoring based on blast radius, actor trust, and security impact.
- **Who approves?** — Governance gates with approval workflows and audit trails.
- **How to communicate?** — AI-powered release notes and multi-channel notifications.

## What Relicta does
- **Plan**: Analyze commits and assess risk to propose the correct semantic version.
- **Notes**: Draft release notes with AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama).
- **Approve**: Lock the plan with governance checks and audit context.
- **Publish**: Create tags and drive plugins (GitHub, npm, Slack, Docker, and more).
- **Govern**: Risk-aware decisions for breaking changes, security updates, and agent-generated code.
- **CI-first**: GitHub Action with signed binaries; no toolchain required on runners.

```bash
brew install relicta-tech/tap/relicta
relicta init                        # write relicta.config.yaml
```

### Option A: One-Command Release
```bash
relicta release                     # complete workflow (plan → bump → notes → approve → publish)
relicta release --yes               # auto-approve for CI/CD
```

### Option B: Step-by-Step
```bash
relicta plan                        # analyze commits, propose version
relicta bump                        # apply version, create tag
relicta notes --ai                  # generate AI-powered release notes
relicta approve                     # review and lock the release
relicta publish                     # tag + run plugins
```
