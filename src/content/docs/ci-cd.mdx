description: Use Relicta in GitHub Actions for zero-install pipelines.
---

Use the GitHub Action to avoid installing the CLI in your workflow runner. Checksums are verified automatically.

```yaml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: relicta-tech/relicta-action@v2
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          ai-provider: openai
          publish: true
```

### Inputs to note
- `github-token` (required for GitHub releases)
- `ai-provider` and related keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Azure, Ollama)
- `config`: path to `relicta.config.yaml` if not in repo root
- `dry-run`: `true` to preview
- `publish`: `true` to run the full flow
