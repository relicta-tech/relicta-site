  <source src="/videos/ai-notes.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

</video>

**📝 Template Notes** (technical, developer-focused):

```markdown
## Features
- **api:** redesign API
- **auth:** add login functions

## Bug Fixes
- **app:** add farewell function
```

**✨ AI-Powered Notes** (user-friendly, contextual):

```markdown
## Breaking Changes
Complete API redesign for better performance.
See migration guide for upgrade instructions.

## What's New
Authentication system with login, logout,
and session management.
```

**Key differences:**
- **Template notes**: Lists commit messages verbatim, technical and developer-focused
- **AI notes**: Summarizes meaningfully, explains user impact, adds migration guidance

Enable AI notes with: `relicta notes --ai` or `relicta release -y --ai`

## Working with Messy Commits

Relicta works great even without perfect conventional commits!

<video controls width="100%" style="border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">
  <source src="/videos/messy-commits.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

**Conventional commits (ideal):**
```
feat(auth): add login and logout functions
fix(api): resolve token expiration bug
docs: update API documentation
```

**Messy commits (real world):**
```
wip
fixed the thing
Update auth.js
actually fixed it this time lol
BREAKING: new api!!!
```

Relicta uses intelligent heuristics to:
- Detect keywords like "BREAKING", "fix", "add"
- Identify fix-like patterns in any commit message
- Group related changes automatically
- Fall back to `patch` for unclear commits
- Use AI to summarize chaotic history into professional notes

**Pro tip:** Use `relicta notes --ai` on messy repositories for best results!

## 5. Custom Plugin Development

Build your own plugin to extend Relicta's functionality.

</video>

**What you'll learn:**
- Creating a plugin project with `relicta plugin create`
- Understanding the plugin structure
- Building and testing your plugin
- Installing a local plugin

## MCP: AI-Managed Releases

Use Relicta with AI agents like Claude for natural language release management.

**🤖 Claude Desktop + Relicta:**

```
You: "What's the release status?"
Claude: "4 commits pending, suggests v2.0.0 (major)"

You: "Generate notes and publish"
Claude: "✓ v2.0.0 published. GitHub release created."
```

**Setup (Claude Desktop):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "relicta": {
      "command": "relicta",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/project"
    }
  }
}
```

**Available MCP tools:**
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `relicta.status` | Get current release state |
| `relicta.plan` | Analyze commits and suggest version |
| `relicta.bump` | Calculate and set version |
| `relicta.notes` | Generate release notes |
| `relicta.evaluate` | CGP risk assessment |
| `relicta.approve` | Approve release |
| `relicta.publish` | Execute release |

See the full [MCP Integration Guide](/mcp) for detailed configuration.
