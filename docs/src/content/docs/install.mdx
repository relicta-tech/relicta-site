Pick the install path that fits your environment.

## Requirements
- Git installed and available on PATH
- macOS, Linux, or Windows (x86_64/arm64)
- For AI features: provider API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Azure OpenAI, or local Ollama)

## Homebrew (recommended)
```bash
brew install relicta-tech/tap/relicta
```

Upgrade:
```bash
brew upgrade relicta
```

## Direct download (macOS Apple Silicon example)
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/relicta-tech/\
relicta/releases/latest/download/relicta_\
Darwin_aarch64.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv relicta_Darwin_aarch64/relicta /usr/local/bin/
```

Replace platform/arch as needed (`Darwin_x86_64`, `Linux_x86_64`, `Linux_aarch64`, `Windows_x86_64`).

## Go install
```bash
go install github.com/relicta-tech/relicta/cmd/relicta@latest
```

## Verify & self-check
```bash
relicta --version
relicta plan --help
```

## Uninstall
- Homebrew: `brew uninstall relicta`
- Manual: remove the binary you placed on PATH

## Troubleshooting
- **“command not found”**: Ensure the install path (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) is on PATH.
- **Missing SSL/CA errors**: Update CA bundles on your OS; curl-based installs require HTTPS.
- **AI provider errors**: Verify the correct API key environment variable for your provider (see Configuration).
